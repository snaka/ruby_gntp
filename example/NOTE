Attention when twitter_notifier.rb is used
Following gem is necessary to operate this script.
- json_pure
- pit

Please ensure that an appropriate value to environment variable EDITOR is set if you start and use Pit.
Pit starts executing the editor command set to EDITOR for the edit of account information, and the script will not operate correctly when this variable is not appropriately set.
